# Introduction
FPL FixtView is a tool for players of Fantasy Premier League and other similar Premier League fantasy football games. It allows the user to view fixtures and apply 
custom settings for colour and fixture difficulty ratings(FDR) for each team. This helps players to visualise the difficulty of upcoming fixtures for each team and identify favourable
fixture runs so that they can plan when to transfer in/out players from certain teams.

FPL FixtView was designed to provide an alternative to the limited FDR page provided on the Fantasy Premier League site - https://fantasy.premierleague.com/fixtures/fdr

The official FDR page is limited in that it doesn't update regularly throughout the season to reflect the good or bad form of teams. Players of the game will also generally disagree
with the ratings provided for certain teams. FPL FixtView solves this problem by letting the user adjust FDR ratings to reflect their own views, to reflect when teams are in good or bad
form or when teams might be hampered by injuries. Users can also choose their own colour scheme and scale. The site uses local storage so that whatever settings are applied will
still be in place when the user returns to the site.
